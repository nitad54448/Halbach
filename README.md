## Overview and Principle of Operation

[cite_start]The paper details the design and operation of a novel system for measuring the Hall effect in materials at elevated temperatures[cite: 3, 25]. [cite_start]The key innovation is the use of a rotating **Halbach magnet array**, which allows for fast, continuous, and versatile measurements under various conditions[cite: 26, 88].

[cite_start]The system is designed to overcome common challenges in high-temperature Hall effect measurements, such as thermal gradients and thermoelectric voltages (Seebeck effect)[cite: 34]. [cite_start]The core of the setup is a donut-shaped Halbach magnet that produces a strong (1 T) and homogeneous magnetic field[cite: 85]. [cite_start]This magnet is mounted on a motorized stage, allowing it to be rotated at controlled speeds (up to ~2 Hz) or fixed at specific angles[cite: 90]. [cite_start]This rotation enables the application of either a DC or an AC magnetic field to the sample[cite: 169].

[cite_start]The sample is mounted on a holder that can be heated up to 773 K and is placed within the magnet's bore[cite: 141, 158]. [cite_start]The system supports multiple measurement modes by combining DC or AC magnetic fields with either DC or AC electrical currents[cite: 169].

* [cite_start]**DC Field Mode**: The magnet is rotated to a series of fixed angles[cite: 176]. [cite_start]The Hall voltage shows a cosine dependence on the angle between the magnetic field and the sample normal[cite: 177]. [cite_start]By plotting the measured voltage against the cosine of the angle, the Hall coefficient is extracted from the slope[cite: 177]. [cite_start]This method is very fast, with a full set of measurements taking only a few seconds[cite: 178].
* [cite_start]**AC Field Mode**: The magnet is rotated continuously at a constant frequency[cite: 264]. [cite_start]This allows the Hall voltage to be measured with a lock-in amplifier, which is highly effective at filtering out DC offsets and noise[cite: 61, 286]. [cite_start]This can be done with either a DC current or a dual-AC method (AC current and AC field) for maximum noise rejection[cite: 263, 283].

[cite_start]The system's ability to perform measurements in seconds allows for the continuous monitoring of material properties during a thermal ramp, a significant advantage over traditional methods requiring long stabilization times[cite: 316, 319].

## Equations

The paper presents the following equations to describe the physical principles:

1.  [cite_start]**General Electric Field Equation**: The electric field ($\vec{E}$) in a material under the influence of a magnetic field is given by[cite: 50]:
    $$ \vec{E} = \rho_{\perp}\vec{j} + \vec{n}(\vec{j}\cdot\vec{n})(\rho_{||} - \rho_{\perp}) + \rho_{H}\vec{n}\times\vec{j} $$

2.  [cite_start]**Measured Hall Voltage**: For an isotropic sample, the measured voltage ($V_H$) across the Hall contacts is dependent on the orientation of the magnetic field[cite: 57]:
    $$ V_{H} = \frac{\mu_{H}\rho}{d}IB\cos\psi + \frac{C\mu_{H}^{2}\rho}{2d}IB^{2}\sin(2\varphi)\sin^{2}\psi $$

3.  [cite_start]**AC/AC Measurement Inputs**: In the AC field/AC current mode, the current ($I$) and magnetic field ($H$) are described as sinusoidal functions[cite: 266]:
    $$ I = I_{0}\cos(\omega_{1}t + \varphi); \quad H = H_{0}\cos(\omega_{2}t) $$

4.  [cite_start]**Resultant Hall Voltage in AC/AC Mode**: The product of the AC current and AC field results in a Hall voltage ($V_H$) with sum and difference frequency components[cite: 269]:
    $$ V_{H} = \frac{R_H}{2d}I_{0}H_{0}\{\cos[(\omega_{1} - \omega_{2})t + \varphi] + \cos[(\omega_{1} + \omega_{2})t + \varphi]\} $$

5.  [cite_start]**Hall Coefficient Calculation**: The Hall coefficient ($R_H$) can be calculated from the measured Hall voltage ($V_H$)[cite: 272]:
    $$ R_{H} = \frac{2d V_{H}}{IH} $$

## Detailed Analysis

### Typical Experimental Results ðŸ§ª

The paper validates the system by testing a range of materials, demonstrating its accuracy and versatility.

* **Platinum (Pt) Film**
    * [cite_start]At room temperature, the system measured an average Hall coefficient of $-0.21 \times 10^{-12} \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm/Gauss}$, which is consistent with reported literature values[cite: 185].
    * [cite_start]It successfully extracted a tiny Hall signal (on the order of $5 \times 10^{-8}$ V) from a much larger offset voltage ($>7.7 \times 10^{-6}$ V), showcasing its sensitivity[cite: 182].
    * [cite_start]The measurements proved to be highly stable over a 48-hour period[cite: 182].

* **Germanium (Ge) Single Crystal**
    * [cite_start]A p-type Ge crystal was tested using all six measurement modes, with all configurations yielding consistent results around $1.9 \times 10^{-5} \, \Omega \cdot \text{cm/Gauss}$[cite: 287, 290].
    * [cite_start]During a high-temperature measurement from 300 K to 625 K, data points were acquired every 5 seconds while the temperature was ramped continuously[cite: 318, 319].
    * [cite_start]The results clearly showed the material's transition from p-type to intrinsic (n-type dominant) behavior at higher temperatures[cite: 312, 317].

* **BiCuSeO (Thermoelectric Material)**
    * [cite_start]The system was used to measure this challenging low-mobility material, where the offset voltage ($10^{-5}$ V) was about 100 times larger than the Hall signal ($10^{-7}$ V)[cite: 382, 383].
    * [cite_start]The room temperature carrier concentration of $2 \times 10^{21} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ matched results from a commercial system[cite: 381].
    * [cite_start]High-temperature measurements showed the carrier concentration increasing up to $2.6 \times 10^{21} \, \text{cm}^{-3}$ at 650 K[cite: 384].

### Comparison of AC and DC Field Modes ðŸ”„

The key difference between the modes is how the magnetic field is applied and how the signal is detected.

#### **DC Field Mode**
* [cite_start]**Principle**: The magnet is moved to a series of fixed angular positions, and a measurement is taken at each static point[cite: 176].
* [cite_start]**Signal Extraction**: The Hall constant is determined from the slope of a line when plotting the measured Hall voltage against the cosine of the angle ($\psi$)[cite: 177].
* [cite_start]**Current**: Can be used with either a DC current or an AC current paired with a lock-in amplifier[cite: 183]. [cite_start]The paper reports no significant difference between the two current methods in this mode[cite: 184].
* [cite_start]**Speed**: This method is very fast, with a full measurement taking just a few seconds[cite: 178]. [cite_start]A "scan" variant, where the magnet rotates slowly (0.2-0.5 Hz), offers a continuous alternative[cite: 248, 251].

#### **AC Field Mode**
* [cite_start]**Principle**: The magnet rotates continuously at a constant frequency (e.g., 1-2 Hz), producing a sinusoidal AC magnetic field[cite: 260, 281].
* [cite_start]**Signal Extraction**: This mode relies on a lock-in amplifier that uses the magnet's rotation as its reference frequency[cite: 164, 284].
    * **AC Field / DC Current**: A DC current results in an AC Hall voltage at the magnet's rotation frequency. [cite_start]The lock-in amplifier isolates this signal, rejecting DC offsets[cite: 283, 286].
    * [cite_start]**AC Field / AC Current**: In this dual-AC method, an AC current (at $\omega_1$) and AC field (at $\omega_2$) produce a Hall voltage at the sum ($\omega_1 + \omega_2$) and difference ($\omega_1 - \omega_2$) frequencies[cite: 263]. [cite_start]Measuring at these sideband frequencies provides excellent noise and offset rejection[cite: 270].
* [cite_start]**Key Advantage**: The primary benefit is superior rejection of parasitic DC offset voltages, which is crucial for measuring low-mobility samples with very small Hall signals[cite: 61, 286].
